A powerful Docker container orchestration service built with Go and Gin framework, providing RESTful APIs for deploying, managing, and scaling containerized services with intelligent port proxying and load balancing.

## ‚ú® Features

- **üöÄ Container Lifecycle Management**: Deploy, update, delete, and scale containerized services
- **üîÑ Smart Port Management**: Automatic port allocation starting from configured base port
- **‚öñÔ∏è Intelligent Load Balancing**: Automatically switch between single-replica proxy and load balancer based on replica count
- **üì¶ Cache Optimization**: Port mapping cache with TTL and manual cleanup support
- **üîß Service Recovery**: Auto-recovery of port proxy services on startup
- **üìä Health Monitoring**: Container status monitoring and instance details query
- **üìñ Swagger Documentation**: Complete API documentation with online testing support
- **üîÄ Multiple Load Balancing Strategies**: Round-robin, least connections, and weighted strategies

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

OneDock adopts a layered architecture with the following core components:

- **API Layer** (`/api/`): RESTful route definitions and HTTP handlers
- **Service Layer** (`/service/`): Core service management, Docker integration, and port management
- **Model Layer** (`/models/`): Complete service data structures and API models
- **Docker Client** (`/library/dockerclient/`): Docker operations abstraction layer
- **Cache Layer** (`/library/cache/`): Memory and Redis cache implementations
- **Utilities** (`/utils/`): Configuration management and common utilities

### Intelligent Proxy System

OneDock features an intelligent proxy system that automatically chooses the optimal proxying strategy:

- **Single Replica Mode**: Uses `httputil.ReverseProxy` for direct proxying when `replicas = 1`
- **Load Balancer Mode**: Automatically enables `LoadBalancer` when `replicas > 1`
- **Dynamic Switching**: Seamlessly switches between modes during scaling operations
- **Access Consistency**: External access port remains unchanged regardless of replica count

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24 or higher
- Docker (must be accessible from the host system)
- Git

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note on Deployment

**OneDock should be deployed as a native binary on the host system, NOT as a Docker container.**

Since OneDock is a Docker container orchestration service that needs to manage Docker containers, running it inside a Docker container would create unnecessary complexity and potential issues:

- **Docker-in-Docker (DinD) complexity**: Requires complex volume mounts and privileged containers
- **Network conflicts**: Port management and proxy functionality may conflict with container networking
- **Security concerns**: Requires elevated privileges and Docker socket access
- **Resource overhead**: Additional layer of containerization without benefits

### Recommended Deployment Methods

1. **Direct Binary Deployment** (Recommended)
2. **Systemd Service** (For production environments)
3. **Process Manager** (PM2, Supervisor, etc.)

### Installation

üìñ **For detailed deployment instructions, see [Deploy Guide](./deploy/README.md)**

#### Quick Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/aichy126/onedock.git
cd onedock

# 2. Build the binary
go build -o onedock

# 3. Install as systemd service (Linux)
sudo ./deploy/install.sh
```

#### Manual Build and Run

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aichy126/onedock.git
   cd onedock
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. **Configure the application**
   ```bash
   cp config.toml.example config.toml
   # Edit config.toml according to your environment
   ```

4. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   ./dev.sh
   ```
   Or run directly:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

5. **Access the API**
   - API Base URL: `http://localhost:8801`
   - Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8801/swagger/index.html`

### Build for Production

```bash
# Build binary
go build -o onedock

# Cross-compile for Linux
CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o onedock-linux

# Generate Swagger docs
swag init
```

## üí° Usage Examples

### Deploy a Service

```bash
curl -X 'POST' 'http://127.0.0.1:8801/onedock' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "nginx-web",
    "image": "nginx",
    "tag": "alpine",
    "internal_port": 80,
    "public_port": 9203,
    "replicas": 3,
    "environment": {
      "ENV": "production"
    }
  }'
```

### Scale a Service

```bash
curl -X 'POST' 'http://127.0.0.1:8801/onedock/nginx-web/scale' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"replicas": 5}'
```

### Get Service Status

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8801/onedock/nginx-web/status
```

### Access the Service

```bash
curl http://localhost:9203/
# Requests are automatically load-balanced across containers
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Edit `config.toml` to customize your deployment:

```toml
[local]
address = ":8801"        # Service listen address
debug = true             # Gin debug mode

[swaggerui]
show = true              # Show Swagger UI
protocol = "http"        # Protocol
host = "127.0.0.1"      # Host address
address = ":8801"        # Port

[container]
prefix = "onedock"                    # Container name prefix
internal_port_start = 30000          # Internal port start value
cache_ttl = 300                      # Cache expiration time (seconds)
load_balance_strategy = "round_robin" # Load balancing strategy
```
